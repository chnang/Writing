The kingfisher is sitting on a mound of dirt next to a coconut palm behind Hugo's place while I'm waiting to order breakfast one morning.
He looks confused maybe or just taking a break from the rain.

I wonder if my apartment is flooding.

There used to be a river in between where that mound of dirt now is and the restaurant I'm sitting in.
The landlord filled it in a week ago.
It's a quiet morning with the rain and the whores that live in the brothel next door won't wake up until after noon.
So I'm staring at the kingfisher while I sip my coffee and I'm remembering.

It's a brief but vivid memory surrounded on either side by grayed out confusion.
It was Christmas Eve.
I'd worked that night, a fairly busy one and then closed the bar quickly and went with my boss and coworkers to a bar in the village.
I'd gotten drunk at work while making sure the owner did the same.
He always got his drinks with a half pour of booze and it was a game of ours to slowly increase the strength of his drinks as the night went on and see who could get him the drunkest.
Of course I was assisted in the effort that night by the fact of it being a holiday and a good time for the business in a season that had gotten off to a slow start.


I've only got little flashes of the bars in the village.


I was back at the beach.
I'd just left the Corner bar that defined one end of Otres 1.
I had been in there with one of my bosses childhood friends who I'd gotten to know quite well since he was at that time under the impression that he had an open tab at the place I worked.
The Corner was Russian-owned and open 24 hours.
They'd moved to the beach from the outskirts of nearby Sihanoukville where their slogan had been "smack in the middle of town."
Once there I realized that I really didn't need anything else.
I accepted an offered beer but didn't want anything that would keep me up.
That would probably be the next thing so I said goodbye and took my beer outside.

The bar I worked at and slept above was at the other side of Otres 1.
Maybe twenty minutes walking or five driving.
There might have been a full moon.
I could see so clearly though the headlight on my red honda motorbike dimmed and surged as I played the accelerator over the bumps and ruts in the dirt road that ran parallel the whole length of the beach to the end of Otres 2.
My bike was semi-automatic, a descendant of the super cub design and made to be able to be driven with one hand.
One hand on the throttle and I stretched the other one out a little ways clutching an almost full beer which sloshed out when I hit a bump wrong and foamed up after every time I lifted it to my mouth for a gulp.

I assume I arrived home, parked my bike and made my way up to my bed in the staff dorm.
The bike ride is what I remember, the cool light of the moon on an empty street lined with shuttered shops and bars.
The warm yellow glow of my bike's headlight rising and falling in rhythm with the sound and feel of the poorly tuned engine.
The rough bumps of those first rear shocks that barely performed their purpose but which I put off replacing until eventually the stress they were supposed to be absorbing caused the entire rear wheel assembly to fundamentally fail.
The cool taste of the beer that I must have spilled more than half of.
Most of all the kind of contented feeling, a feeling of such calm and enjoyment.
That kind of singular beautiful moment that makes one sure that if this moment and experience are the result of all the choices and circumstances that came before it then everything is alright.
That even those things I regret or whatever minor misfortunes had befallen me they were all worth it if they allowed for or lead to a moment like this.
That beautiful feeling of jubilant freedom to live in that one moment alone without a single care for what tomorrow might bring.
